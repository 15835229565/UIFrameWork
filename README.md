# UIFrameWork
A tiny and powerful UIFrameWork for Unity4.x

**[中文介绍](https://github.com/tinyantstudio/UIFrameWork/blob/master/ChineseReadMe.md)**

## How to Start

1. Click the **MainStart.scene** in Scenes folder
2. find GameObject **"!!!DemoDriver!!!"** in scene
3. Toggle the **DebugSystem Enable Log**
4. play the **"Game"** from one window to other window ,back to another window ......

## Important information
1. Unity4.x & NGUI3.6.7(If you want using Unity3d 5.x version, just update the NGUI's right version too)

## UIFrameWork Target:
1. load window, Show, hide, close window
2. Animation Interface for your window hide/show animation
3. Window Depth, window common collider bg manager
4. (!!!maybe the most goal)Manager your window navigation (when you click the return/back button you need not to care which window I should Go)
5. Add some very common MessageBox
6. Give you a total game example(just the window logic)
7. You can easily modify for your own game
8. Do more (event system , Decoupled your game code)


## Updating:
1. MVC? 
2. Add a common Event system to this framework( Decoupled goal for communication between the window and your game logic)
3. optimizing the code (such as GC problem, the code design and son on)
4. thinking......
5. UGUI? Just change the window depth manager or something relevant to NGUI

## Updated

**2016.8.19**

1. Add some core comment for explain the navigation system(UICenterCoreManager is the KEY core manager)
2. delete some unused file , clear the folder
3. fixed Dictionary<Enum,int> boxing bug
4. Add a new DebugSystem ,you can toggle the Console debug(use Debuger.Log("");Not the Debug.Log("");)
5. rename all the example scenes for easy understanding
